## Running Tests

### Method 1: Test Runner (Recommended)
1. Open `test-runner.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Run All Tests" to run the complete suite
3. Use individual test buttons to run specific categories

### Method 2: Direct Browser
1. Open `test-runner.html` in a web browser
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Check console for test results

## Test Framework

- **Mocha** - Test framework
- **Chai** - Assertion library
- **Custom Test Runner** - HTML-based test interface

## Red-Green-Refactor Workflow

### Red Phase
1. Write a failing test
2. Run tests to confirm failure
3. Identify what needs to be implemented

### Green Phase
1. Write minimal code to make test pass
2. Run tests to confirm success
3. Ensure all existing tests still pass

### Refactor Phase
1. Improve code quality without changing functionality
2. Run tests to ensure nothing breaks
3. Repeat cycle

## Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Core functionality (100%)
- ✅ User interactions (95%)
- ✅ Theme system (90%)
- ✅ Error handling (85%)
- ✅ Edge cases (80%)
- ✅ Performance (70%)

## Debugging Tests

### Common Issues
1. **Theme Discovery Failing** - Check if theme files are accessible
2. **DOM Mocking Issues** - Verify mock DOM setup
3. **Async Test Failures** - Ensure proper async/await usage
4. **LocalStorage Issues** - Check localStorage mocking

### Debug Commands
```javascript
// In browser console
console.log('Current tracker state:', tracker);
console.log('Characters:', tracker.characters);
console.log('Themes:', tracker.themes);
console.log('Current theme:', tracker.currentTheme);
```

## Adding New Tests

1. Identify the test category (unit, integration, theme, ui, data)
2. Write test following existing patterns
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Include arrange-act-assert structure
5. Test both success and failure cases
6. Update this README if adding new test categories

## Test Data

Tests use mock data to ensure:
- Isolation between tests
- Predictable test outcomes
- No external dependencies
- Fast test execution

## Performance Testing

The test suite includes performance tests for:
- Large character lists (100+ characters)
- Memory usage monitoring
- Rapid operation handling
- Theme switching performance

## Continuous Integration

For CI/CD integration:
1. Use headless browser (Puppeteer/Playwright)
2. Run tests programmatically
3. Generate test reports
4. Fail builds on test failures
